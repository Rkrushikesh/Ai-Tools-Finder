      There are several approaches used to create AI, including rule-based systems, decision trees, artificial neural networks, and evolutionary algorithms 
 Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are a type of machine learning algorithm that is inspired by the way biological neurons signal to one another in the human brain  ANNs consist of layers of interconnected nodes that process information and learn from it. The nodes are connected by synapses, which are similar to the connections between neurons in the brain 
 Neurons are the basic building blocks of the nervous system, including the brain. They are specialized cells that transmit information throughout the body 2. Neurons have three main parts: the cell body, dendrites, and axon. The cell body contains the nucleus and other organelles, while the dendrites receive signals from other neurons. The axon carries signals away from the cell body to other neurons or muscles

      Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines. Here’s a simple breakdown:        
    </div>  
     <br>
       1. Acting Humanly (The Turing Test Approach): This approach aims to make computers behave so convincingly like humans that we can’t distinguish between them. Imagine a computer chatbot that talks like a human, fooling us into thinking it’s a person. <br><br>
       2. Thinking Humanly (The Cognitive Modeling Approach): This approach focuses on whether a computer can think like a human. It involves creating models that mimic human thought processes, such as reasoning, memory, and problem-solving. 
       <br><br>
       3. Thinking Rationally (The “Laws of Thought” Approach): Here, the goal is to determine if a computer can think logically and rationally. It’s about using formal rules and logical reasoning to solve problems, similar to how humans do.
       <br><br>
       4.Generative AI: This newer approach involves creating AI systems that generate new content, such as images, music, or text. It’s like teaching a computer to be creative and come up with original ideas

      <div class="bulletPoints"> Bullet Points ! <span class="mainLine"> ৲   ai is the logical representation of human brain present in electronic device  </span> </div>

     <ul>

      <li class="bullet"> a) human brain Structure </li>
     <li> » scientist get idea to create ai from human brain structure actually they wanted to stored human brain in the electronic place </li>
     <li> » human brain actually works on already presented  data in neurons ( neurons is the part of human brain where information is stored ) </li>
     <li> » human brain collets information through senses ( nose, eye ,eyer ,  tongue, skin )</li>
     <li> » human brain having billions of fixed neurons they are passing information through neurons to neurons , when neurons is not in regular use  it will    become empty automatcally </li>
     <li> » human brain having ability to proceed on that data present in neurons as needed automatically </li>

     <p class="p">
      The human brain collects information through multiple senses, such as the nose, eyes, ears, tongue, and skin. For example, when humans receive information through their eyes, they may see words that could be a question. The brain then checks if the information related to the question is present in the neurons. If the information is present, the brain fetches the related information through the neurons. Neurons have a capacity to store a specific amount of data, and there are billions of fixed neurons present in the brain. To travel information through neurons, the brain uses cells. The main feature of human neurons is that they become empty after some time when they are not in regular use. When a neuron becomes empty, it is capable of storing new information. This loop continuously runs.
     </p>
     <li class="bullet2">b ) Ai logical Structure </li>
     <li> » in structure of ai neurons word replace with memory (memory is the electronic place where data are stored) 
     </li>
     <li> » memory collets data through input devices ( keyboard , mouse etc )
    </li>
     <li>» scientist can design memory so the size of memory is uncountable 
    </li>
    <li>» having full control on accessed data through input devices ( data can be shared delete manually )</li>
    <li>» getting the idea how exactly human brain is working automatically they return a program like how human how brains deal with neurons automatically</li>  </ul>
    <p class="storingInfo">
  
      how ai is storing information - ai is simply storing information into the memory but before that Ai have a such beatiful pattern of code that code is going to sotre the new When new informatiion is come to ai. 
      
       </p>
  
 <p class="memory">
 <span class="memory1"> Work  Flow of Ai </span>
 How ai deal with stored information ai also do same like human brain how human brain is collecting information thought the neurons , here ai collectes infromation thought the memory and because of  some already written pattern ai can understand Input(question) or answered for that perticular question's answer.

 Already writtern pattern means suppose for first time human can't understand the test of ice or feel of ice , but when it examine then that feeled or tested information stored into the neurons and whenever Throught the eyes see the ice it can automatically told that without examination Test or feel of that ice , just like that when information filded into the memory - (that information have to more informative because Ai don't have sense organs there for have to provide detailed information - have to provide question with the answer then it will answer the particular question for the next time )

 <span class="wf">  how they are training that brain -   </span> 
 <p class="workFlow">
how AI systems are trained to answer questions based on existing data. To achieve this, computer scientists provide the AI system with a set of questions and their corresponding answers, which the system uses to learn how to answer similar questions in the future. The process of answering a particular question involves analyzing the question, identifying the relevant information in the existing data, and generating an answer based on that information. The AI system can use various techniques, such as machine learning algorithms and natural language processing, to improve its ability to answer questions over time

ex - One way to train AI is through machine learning. Machine learning involves teaching an AI system to recognize patterns in data and make predictions based on that data. For example, a machine learning algorithm can be trained to recognize images of cats and dogs by being fed thousands of labeled images of cats and dogs. The algorithm learns to identify the features that distinguish cats from dogs and can then classify new images as either cats or dogs. This is similar to how humans learn to recognize objects by seeing many examples of them. Does that help?

   <p class="p1">Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science that focuses on creating machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation. The history of AI dates back to ancient times, with myths and stories of artificial beings endowed with intelligence or consciousness by master craftsmen  However, the modern era of AI began in the 1940s with the invention of the programmable digital computer, which inspired scientists to begin seriously discussing the possibility of building an electronic brain  The field of AI research was founded at a workshop held on the campus of Dartmouth College, USA during the summer of 1956  Many of the attendees predicted that a machine as intelligent as a human being would exist in no more than a generation, and they were given millions of dollars to make this vision come true However, it became obvious that researchers had grossly underestimated the difficulty of the project  In 1974, in response to the criticism from James Lighthill and ongoing pressure from congress, the U.S. and British Governments stopped funding undirected research into artificial intelligence, and the difficult years that followed would later be known as an “AI winter”  Investment and interest in AI boomed in the 2020s when machine learning was successfully applied to many problems in academia and industry due to new methods, the application of powerful computer hardware, and the collection of immense data sets
